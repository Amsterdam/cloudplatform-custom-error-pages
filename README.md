## Stack

This repo uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) to generate the pages.
Astro allows you to generate completely static, JavaScript-free pages, which makes sense for static error pages.
The pages themselves are created using [Amsterdam Design System](https://designsystem.amsterdam/) React components.
